Let me show you everything I know
The jungle slang
Spinning around my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky gooey womb
A woozy womb
Dope so good, a silky smooth perfume
Ride my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance
Wanna sip this smooth air, kick it in the sand
I'd say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes
Mind my simple song, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy smirk
I can't take this place, I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space
Truth be told
I've been here, I've done this all before
I tell you go gloom
I cut it up and puff it into bloom
Ride my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance
Wanna sip this smooth air, kick it in the sand
I'd say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes
Mind my simple song, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy smirk
I can't take this place, I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space
Hold my hand, flow back to the summer time
Tangled in the willows, now comes the tide
How can I believe you, how can I be nice
Tripping around the tree stumps in your summer smile
Ride my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance
Wanna sip this smooth air, kick it in the sand
I'd say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes
Mind my simple song, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy smirk
I can't take this place, I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space`
