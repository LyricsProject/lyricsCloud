Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it
I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm staying there just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired

[Chorus]
Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

[Verse 2]
Said they'd give you anything you ever wanted
When they lied, I knew it was just stable
Children trying hard not to realize
I was sitting right behind you

[Bridge]
Dear, can't you see? It's them it's not me
We're not enemies, we just disagree
If I was like him, all dissing his pa
He changes his mind, says I went too far
We all disagree, I think we should disagree, yeah

[Chorus]
Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

[Verse 1]
Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it
I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm staying there just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired

[Verse 1]
Up on a hill, here's where we begin
This little story, a long time ago
Start to pretend, stop pretending
It seems this game is simply never-ending

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, in the sun shine having fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now, let me go
Oh, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go

[Chorus]
Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean, trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy, do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different, so I'll pretend I'm leaving

[Verse 2]
I feel so different now, we trained at A-V-A
I wish you hadn't stayed, my vision's clearer now but I'm unafraid
Flying overseas, no time to feel the breeze
I took too many varieties

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, in the sun shine having fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now, let me go
Darling, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go

[Chorus]
Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean, trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy, do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different, so I'll pretend I'm leaving


Soma is what they would take when
Hard times opened their eyes, saw pain in a new way
High stakes for a few names, racing against sunbeams
Losing against their dreams, in your eyes

[Chorus]
And I am stop and go
In your eyes
See, I am stop and go
In your eyes
Let's go

[Verse 2]
When I saw her for the first time
Lips moved as her eyes closed, heard something in his voice
"And I'll be there", he says then he walks out
Somehow he was trying too hard to be like them

[Chorus]
And I am stop and go
In your eyes
And I am stop, oh, darling let me go

[Outro]
Tried it once and they liked it, and tried to hide it
Says, "I've been doing this twenty-five years"
Well, I'm not listening no more
And these friends they keep asking for more
Oh, yeah
Oh, but that's it


I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, mama running out of luck
Well, like my sister, don't give a fuck
I wanna steal your innocence
To me, my life, it don't make any sense
These strange manners, I loved 'em so
Why won't you wear your new trench coat?

[Verse 2]
I should have worked much harder
I should have just not bothered
I never show up on weekdays
And something that you learned yesterday
Drive you to work and you'll be on time
These little problems, they're not yours, they're mine
Come on, listen to what I say
I've got some secrets that'll make you stay

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want to turn you down
I just want to turn you around
Oh, you ain't never had nothing I wanted, but
I want it all, I just can't figure out nothing

[Chorus]
And all together, it went well
We made pretend, we were best friends
Then she said, "Oh, you're a freak"
They ordered me to make mistakes
Together again, like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
But for the record, it's between you and I

[Verse 3]
I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, mama running out of luck
Bit like my sister, don't give a fuck
I wanna steal your innocence
To me, my life, it just don't make any sense
Strange manners, I loved 'em so
Why won't you wear your new trench coat?

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want to misbehave
I just want to be your slave
Oh, you ain't never had nothing I wanted, but
I want it all, I just can't figure out nothing

[Chorus]
And all together, it went well
We made pretend, we were best friends
Then she said, "Oh, I can wait"
They ordered me to make mistakes
Together again, like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
But for the record, it's between you and I


In many ways, they'll miss the good old days
Someday, someday
Yeah, it hurts to say but I want you to stay
Sometimes, sometimes
When we was young, oh man, did we have fun?
Always, always
Promises, they break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes

[Chorus]
Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you wanna stand by my side
Darling, your head's not right
See, alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
No, I ain't wasting no more time
(Trying, trying)

[Verse 2]
And now my fears, they come to me in threes
So I sometimes
Say, "Fate, my friend, you say the strangest things I find
Sometimes"

[Chorus]
Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
Shit, I will try my best
You say you wanna stand by my side
Darling, your head's not right
See, alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
I ain't wasting no more time


No choice now, it's too late
Let him go, he gave up, I gave up
Lisa said, "Take time for me"
Dropping him down to his knees, ah, chest down

[Chorus]
Take me away, see I've got to explain
Things, they have changed in such a permanent way
Life seems unreal, can we go back to your place?
Oh, "You drink too much" makes me drink just the same

[Verse 2]
People tried, felt so right
Giving themselves good advice
Looking down sometimes felt nice
He knows it's justified to kill to survive
He then in dollars makes more dead than alive
Let's suck more blood, let's run three hours a day
The world is over but I don't care

[Chorus]
'Cause I am with you, now I've got to explain
Things, they have changed in such a permanent way
Life seems unreal, can we go back to your place?
Oh, "You drink too much" makes me drink just the same

[Outro]
The first time, it happened too fast
The second time, I thought it would last
We all like it a little different


Last night, she said, "Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh, it turn me off when I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round, oh, baby, don't care no more
I know this for sure, I'm walking out that door
Well, I've been in town for just about fifteen, oh, minutes now
And baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why I keep walking for miles

[Chorus]
And say, people, they don't understand
Your girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

[Verse 2]
Last night, she said, "Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turn me off when I feel left out"
So I, I turned round, oh, baby, gonna be alright
It was a great big lie, 'cause I left that night, yeah

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Oh, people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

[Verse 3]
Last night, she said, "Oh, baby, I feel so down
See, it turn me off when I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round, oh, little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure, I'm walking out that door, yeah


Was an honest man
Asked me for the phone, tried to take control
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way
We shared some ideas
All obsessed with fame, says we're all the same
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way

[Pre-Chorus]
Raised in Carolina, I'm not like that
Trying to remind her when we go back

[Chorus]
I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train
I'll try, but you see, it's hard to explain
I say the right thing but act the wrong way
I like it right here but I cannot stay
I'm watching TV, forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young and they are too old
The joke is on you, this place is a zoo
You're right, it's true

[Verse 2]
He said he can't decide
I shake my head to say, "Everything's just great"
Oh, I just can't remember
I just can't remember

[Pre-Chorus]
Raised in Carolina, she says, "I'm not like that"
Trying to remind her when we go back

[Chorus]
I say the right thing but act the wrong way
I like it right here but I cannot stay
I'm watching TV, forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young and they are too old
Oh man, can't you see, I'm nervous, so please
Pretend to be nice so I can be mean
I missed the last bus, we'll take the next train
I'll try, but you see, it's hard to explain


Ow! Haha, I meant, ah!
No, I didn't mean that at all
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Here in the streets so mechanized
Rise to the bottom of the meaning of life
Studied all the rules and didn't want no part
But I let you in just to break this heart
Even though it was only one night
It was fucking strange

[Pre-Chorus]
Nina's in the bedroom, she said, "Time to go now"
But leavin' it ain't easy, I got to let go, oh, I got to let go
And the hours they ran slow
I said, every night, she just can't stop saying

[Chorus]
New York City cops, New York City cops
New York City cops, but they ain't too smart
New York City cops, New York City cops
New York City cops, but they ain't too smart

[Verse 2]
Well, kill me now cause I let you down
I swear one day I'm gonna leave this town
Stop! Yes, I'm leaving, 'cause it just won't work
And they act like Romans, but they dress like Turks
Some time in your prime
See me, I like the summertime but, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Nina's in the bedroom, she said, "Time to go now"
But leaving, it ain't easy, oh, I got to let go, oh, I got to let go, oh
Trapped in an apartment, she would not let them get her
She wrote it in a letter, I got to come clean
The authorities they've seen, darling, I'm somewhere in between
I said, every night, she just can't stop saying

[Chorus]
New York City cops, New York City cops
New York City cops, but they ain't too smart
New York City cops, New York City cops
New York City cops, but they ain't too smart


You said you couldn't stay
You've seen it all before, I know
And sold you on their way
Oh, honey, that's okay

[Pre-Chorus]
No harm, he's armed, setting off all your alarms
When I find out, I hope it's you who set this trap

[Verse 2]
And store fronts rarely change
At least I'm on my own again
Instead of anywhere with you
Oh, tell me it's all the same

[Chorus]
And I've lost my page again
I know this is surreal but I'll try my luck with you
Oh, this life is on my side, oh, I am your one
Believe me this is a chance, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Let's see what is for sale
He's trying not to give his job a chance
Oh, it's never gonna be
It's sad, but I agree
The signals don't seem right
It lasts for just one night and then
I'm sorry that I said
That we were just good friends

[Pre-Chorus]
No harm, he's armed, setting off all your alarms
Entranced, I can't be here in time, I'll think about that

[Chorus]
And I've lost my page again
I know this is surreal but I'll try my luck with you
Oh, this life is on my side, well, I am your one
Believe me, oh, this is a chance, oh, oh


Leave me alone
I'm in control, I'm in control
And girls act too much and boys act too tough
Enough is enough
We're on the minds of other men, I know she was

[Chorus]
I said just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, and take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, oh, just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, oh, take it

[Bridge]
I say, oh, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down, he's gonna let you down
And gonna break your back for a chance
And gonna steal your friends, if he can
He's gonna win someday

[Verse 2]
I fell off the track, now I can't go back
I'm not like that
Boys act too much, girls act too tough
Enough is enough
We're on the minds of other girls, I know he was

[Chorus]
I said just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, and take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, oh, just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, oh, take it

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Oh, that's right, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down, he's gonna let you down
And gonna break your back for a chance
And gonna steal your friends, if he can
He's gonna win someday, oh, he will


Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, "Thanks my friend, thought it was too late"
Oh, why? Oh, why? I don’t know
So you think things move pretty fast down here?
Well, just wait, my dear, ‘til you look up there
Oh, maybe some day you’ll know
Had his second kid, was an early night
Got to be well-dressed 'cause he hates to fly
Oh, loves his job, takes it home

[Chorus]
Anything they wanted
They could have it, have it
Didn't even notice
I don't mind it, mind it

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, "Thanks my friend, thought that we was dead"
Oh, why? Oh, why? I don't know
Think things move pretty fast down here?
But just wait, my dear, 'til we get up there
Oh, maybe some day they'll know

[Chorus]
Come on, tell me does she warm the room
When he comes?
Or does he just know
How to leave when it gets cold?

[Outro]
Well I don't care, I don't care
'Cause it's free
