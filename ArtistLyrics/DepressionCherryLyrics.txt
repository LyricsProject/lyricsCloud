You and me with our long hair on the gold wall
After midnight we could feel it all
I'd go anywhere you want to

You should see there's a place I want to take you
When the train comes I will hold you
(When the train comes I will hold you)
Cause you blow my mind

On the bridge levitating cause we want to
When the unknown will surround you
(When the unknown will surround you)
There is no right time
There is no right time

The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now
You will grow too quick
Then you will get over it

The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now

There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will surround you
There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will be looking for you (for your heart)
When the unknown will surround you (Take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly
There's a place I want to take you (for your heart)
When the unknown will looking for you
When the unknown will surround you (take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly

There's a place I want to take you

Were you high when they knocked on the door looking for you
When the unknown will surround you
Take my hand as our bodies lift up slowly
There's a place I want to take you

We drive around this town
Houses melting down
A vision turning green
Is all we've ever seen
And then it's dark again
A new development
Wishing that it meant
Something natural
Don't we know it's cruel
And it goes dark again
Just like a spark

[Verse 2]
Hallucination comes
Think of everyone
That never shared before
From my mouth to yours
And then it's dark again
Just like a spark
And then it vanishes
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark
And then we're vanishing
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark

[Bridge]
You go to school, you follow all the rules, you live inside
Realize there's something in your eyes, you're back again
From the spine rising through the mind, you give it up
(Just like a spark)
It's a gift taken from the lips, you live again

[Outro]
Make it
Wave it
Alive
Make it
Wave it
Alive

It was late at night
You held on tight
From an empty sea
A flash of light

It will take a while
To make you smile
Somewhere in these eyes
I’m on your side

You wide eyed girls
You get it right

Fall back into place
Fall back into place

Tender is the night
For a broken heart
Who will dry your eyes
When it falls apart?

What makes this fragile world go 'round?
Were you ever lost
Was she ever found?
Somewhere in these eyes

Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back in

Beyond love
The first thing that I do before I get into your house
I'm gonna tear off all the petals
From the rose that's in your mouth

Beyond love
You wanted to find Elvis and I didn't understand
They take the simple things inside you
And put nightmares in your hands

Beyond love
This man comes to me
Heartbreak did this
He was made to believe
That he should live without it
All I know's what I see
No change in this
Visions born in the dreams
Of a world left without it

We really wanna know
We really do agree
We really do agree
We really wanna know

The last thing that she sees before they turn off all the lights
Was there, a man up in the corner with the spiders made of light

We really wanna know
Beyond love
All I know is what I see and I can't live without this
Could you ever believe beyond love?

I really wanna know
I really wanna know

Chances are
Like night you’ll disappear
Caught in the atmosphere

[Verse 2]
Where you go
She casts no shadow
Still you know she's near

L–

[Verse 3]
Here she comes
All parts of everything
Stars in the motherhand

[Verse 4]
With the dark thunder
Above you
Come to us soaring

L–a–i–

Chances are

[Verse 5]
10:37
House made of the dawn
Disappears

Out in the heartland
I looked in your eyes
Asked "are you ready
Ready for this life?"

[Verse 2]
Did you see it coming?
It happened so fast
The timing was perfect
Water on glass

[Chorus]
Like tracing figure eights
On ice in skates oh well
And if this ice should break
It would be my mistake

[Verse 3]
Between the cities
Between the thrills
There's something inside you
That doesn't sleep well

[Verse 4]
It won't last forever
Or maybe it will
The white clothes they gave you
You wear them so well

[Verse 5]
Someone once told me
In love, that you must
Place all you're given
In infinite trust

[Chorus]
Yet I'm tracing figure eights
On ice in skates so well
And if this ice should break
It would be my mistake

No better color
Looked everywhere
We're driving home every night
The shadows stay by your side

You built a city
All in your head
Triangle of ever light
It turns you on every night

Need a companion
A hidden prayer
You know you're not losing your mind
What’s left you make something of it
The sky and what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Baby I'm yours

No better color
Look everywhere
You built a city
All in your head
You know you're not losing your mind
What’s left you make something of it
The sky and what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Wildflower

Light that comes up
On the ceiling
My mouth
And these arms
Hold the feeling

Even I
Can't control
My nature

If they should come up much before you
I would not ever
Try to capture you

Bluebird, where you gonna go now?

Lead me to
The gallows
Where out
Corner my eye
There's something
It's pulling me back from nothing
From nothing

If they should come up much before you
I would not ever
Try to capture you

Bluebird, where you gonna go now?

Scenes change
Before they are over
Before they are over

No one could find you
Out on your own
All things I loved
But do not know
On Hopewell Road

These days of candy
Live in your mind
Those violet lines
White fenced in miles
Across my eyes

A world inside you
No photograph
My natural one
The rising sun
Live in your mind

Just like that, it's gone
Just like that, it's gone
Just like that

I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding off with you

Hi o, out there, I know
A little bit of you I keep it close to me
I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding on with you
I know it comes too soon
I know it stays for nobody
I want to know you there
The universe is riding off with you
