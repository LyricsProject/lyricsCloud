Hum
You're humming
Tomorrow's never sold
But you're singing the only words you know
Would you cry if I lied?
Told a tale?

[Chorus]
I chose yeah
You're ringing the only wedding bell
And we're swimming the seas we know so well
I tried to stay alive
In our head, in our head
Oh, but your wish is my command

[Bridge]
Oh, is your heart still mine to sail?
I'd enjoy nothing more

[Chorus]
I chose yeah
You're ringing the only wedding bell
And we're swimming the seas we know so well
I tried to stay alive
In our head, in our head
Oh, but your wish is my command

Invite your sister
Into the garden
All cannot play
Fist full of wild flowers
Hand picked by someone
Who nearly fell

(Ahhh, ahhh)

Friend, foe, or feather
If we roll together
Give my gift to you
In all kinds of weather
If not now, not ever
Please do not go

Hands over your eyes
In all of your sides
Is it the right time for the game we play?
In all kinds of weather
If not now, not ever
This is the right time for a holiday

(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)

You came to me in my dreams
And you spoke of everything
Sweet remedies ignite my dreams
Holy words dig early graves

(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)

Man, you got a lot of jokes to tell
So you throw your baby's pennies down the well
Give a little more than you like
Pick apart the past, you're not going back

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Hook]
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a

[Verse 2]
Sure, you've got a handle on the past
It's why you keep your little lovers in your lap
Give a little more than you like
Pick apart the past, you're not going back

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Hook]
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a

[Bridge]
Hoping for the last ship to arrive
I am blessed with a kingdom, half mine

[Hook]
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a-a

[Verse 1]
Down the hill I'd hoped that Iâ€™d find
Something I could rest my hands on
In the distance, sun is setting
Deer are jumping over hedges

[Chorus]
By the dock of the pond, Turtle Island
I will wait for you there, creeping silently
I can't keep you right behind me
All my days in the--

[Verse 2]
In the waters, trace her features
Did they scare you?
Hardened creatures
In that murky green perfection
Did they warn you of dissection?

How?
What?
Why?
When?

[Chorus]
By the dock of the pond, Turtle Island
I will wait for you there, creeping silently
I can't keep you right behind me
All my days in the--

[Bridge]
How I want Olive to know
That inside me, she will always grow
In all colors and prizes
You will always remain

[Chorus]
By the dock of the pond, Turtle Island
By the dock of the pond, Turtle Island
I can't keep you right behind me
All my days in the sun

In the night, I called your name
Heart of mine, one letter at a time
I'll be found in a land of savages

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't know what you've got
Spent your money on the desert lot
Holy dances and acronyms for her

[Verse 2]
Bury your maps, they'll take all your pots and pans
Cross all your hands, one finger at a time
You'll be found in a land of savages

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't know what you've got
Husk to hide, and I know you're not
Spending money on a desert rose
Holy dances and acronyms for bones

[Verse 1]
I was sitting on a rock
Just waiting for a key
To sleep inside the house of old serenity

So I climbed onto your altar
Begged, "Please, don't let me falter."
We'll put our oaths at stake
In a heaven that all icicles make

[Chorus]
All my devotion
Compelled by an ocean
Of, of all the years to come
Of, of all the years to come
Of all the years to come
Of all the years to come

[Verse 2]
So we'll work until the night is quite
What once all our dreams were like
Doing all the housework
Returning all the schoolbooks for good

Let's go on pretending that the light is never-ending
So we'll still have the summers
Let's be good to one another, yeah


In your heart of chambers
Where you sit
With your picture books
And your ancient wit
In that nook I found you
So old and tired
Would you be the one to carry me?

[Chorus]
I'd like to be someone
You could finally learn to love again

[Verse 2]
Made our iron bed side
Cold as graves
So we stoke the organs
That make up the grace
And they've conjured spirits
To make you smile
Would you be my long time baby?

[Chorus]
I'd like to be someone
You could finally learn to...

[Bridge]
We've put our walls down at our sides
Let's take the time to mend these smiles
Together we could make it home
Love is a prize
Live our own lives

[Outro]
In our beds, we're the lucky ones
Fill us with the sun
In our beds, we're the lucky ones
Fill us with the sun
In our beds, we're the lucky ones
Fill us with the sun

Your picture
Is still
On my wall
On my wall

The colors
Are bright
Bright
As ever

Red is strong
Blue is true

Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

Come over to my house
I'll pour some tea for us
One sugar or two
Your hand is right in front of me
Your finger fragile-ly
Holding on my side

[Verse 2]
Faster than an astronaut
Who's coming home to what
He left long ago
I've made this brand new bed for you
I trust the things we do
Holy or not

[Chorus]
Open the gate, 'cause you're already late
At the end of the lane is a glass of lemonade
Keep on the path when you hear the laugh
In the white of her palm is your heart

[Bridge]
I'll be brave for a while
I won't bring you down
Any more than you are

I'll be brave for a while
I won't bring you down
Any more than you are


[Outro]
Please, be my baby
Don't be maybe or not
Look out the window
There's a bright yellow cab

Please, be my baby
Don't be maybe or not

Where did you come from?
You're no stranger
How I know you will return
So I won't be sad
D.A.R.L.I.N.G

[Chorus]
In this harbor of a room
You'll find your anchor soon
In the parting of our ways
May it never happen, anyway

[Verse 2]
In the highest blackened moon
There'd be more life
In the right shade of our sighs
Death, be gone
D.A.R.L.I.N.G

[Chorus]
In this harbor of a room
You'll find your anchor soon
In the parting of our ways
May it never happen, anyway

[Outro]
All of your charms
Couldn't keep you from...

Home again, driven back
She's still waiting for a friend
Little purple organdy
Remember what you've always meant to me

[Refrain]
Something in the way your heart is nailed upon a hand
Swimming in the cold waters, head above the sand

[Verse 2]
Heaven, baby, is in an hour
With your heart in handfuls, forbidden flowers
Bread and bonnets along the way
Better take your chances while there's still a ray

[Refrain]
Something in the way your heart is nailed upon a hand
Swimming in the cold waters, head above the sand

[Chorus]
Constant heart of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with him
Will I swim out of your ocean?

Constant heart of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with him
Will I swim out of your ocean?

Constant heart of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with him
Will I swim out of your ocean?
