You know you're gold
You don't gotta worry none
Oasis child
Born and so wild
Don't I know you
Better than the rest
All deception
All deception from you

Your love is stag
In the white sand
Wilderness for miles
Eyes so mild and wise
Don't I know you
Better than the rest
All deception
All deception from you

[Chorus]
Any way you run
You run before us
Black and white horse
Arching among us

[Verse 2]
Your love is stag
In the white sand
Oasis child
Born into a man
Don't I know you
Better than the rest
All deception
All deception from you

Wilderness for miles
Eyes so mild and wise
Oasis child
Born and so wild
Don't I know you
Better than the rest
All deception
All deception from you

[Chorus]
Any way you run
You run before us
Black and white horse
Arching among us`,
`[Verse 1]
We gather matters of the heart
So we can act a fool
It's incomplete without you
The silver soul is running through
It's a vision, complete illusion, yeah

[Verse 2]
The needle along the spinning wheel
Collecting silver coil
It gathers heat without you
Whether or not you're turned from it
It's a quick turn
To let it figure out

[Hook]
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again

[Verse 3]
The bodies lying in the sand
They're moving in the dark
It is so quick to let us
We feel it move through our skin
It's a sickness, a manic weakness, yeah

[Hook / Outro]
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again`,
`[Verse 1]
We were sleeping till
You came along
With your tiny heart
You let us in the wooden house
To share in all the wealth

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know it's true?

[Hook]
Norway
Norway

[Verse 2]
Seven figures leap the hungry mouths
The beast, he comes to you
He's a hunter for a lonely heart
In the season of the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know it's true?

[Hook]
Norway
Norway

[Bridge]
Where you thinking that you gotta run to now
With the beating of a tiny heart?
Hang on to the things that you're supposed to say
Millions of stars, they open to your fate

[Outro]
Norway
Norway
Norway
Norway`,
`[Verse 1]
You go for a walk in the park
'Cause you don't need anything
Your hand that you sometimes hold
Doesn't do anything
The face that you see in the door
Isn't standing there anymore

[Chorus]
In a matter of time
It would slip from my mind
In and out of my life
You would slip from my mind
In a matter of time

[Verse 2]
The face that you saw in the door
Isn't looking at you anymore
The name that you call in its place
Isn't waiting for your embrace
The world that you love to behold
Cannot hold you anymore

[Chorus]
In a matter of time
It would slip from my mind
In and out of my life
You would slip from my mind
In a matter of time

[Outro]
More, you want more
More, you want more
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me`,
`[Verse 1]
You are coming home
Are you still alone?
Are you not the same as you used to be?

As the sun grows high
And you serve your time
Does each day just feel like another lie?

Now you know
Is it just for show?
Just a foolish game that you hide behind?

Don't forget the nights
When it all felt right
Are you not the same as you used to be?

[Hook]
Used to be
Used to be
Used to be

[Verse 2]
In an endless night
Could you feel the fright
Of an age that was and could never be?

So we hold it close
When we feel the most
Like a love that we could not leave behind

Turn the wheel
To each way we feel
'Til I'm lost and I cannot find you there

Don't forget the nights
When it all felt right
Are you not the same as you used to be?

[Hook]
Used to be
Used to be

[Outro]
Coming home any day now
Any day now, any day now
Coming home any day now
Any day now, any day now
Coming home any day now
Any day now, any day now`,
`[Verse]
You hear my cry, lover of mine
No tear in the eye or fear in my mind
The forest is thick and you don't recognize
We parted our lips and we reached from inside

[Hook]
Wide open field
We know we can feel
Awake and unreal
Off to nowhere
Off to nowhere
Off to nowhere

[Verse]
Need more people to be satisfied
No fear of a god and a prayer for the night
Come into our minds and you rush through our lives
We parted our lips and we reached from inside

[Hook]
Wide open field
We know we can feel
Awake and unreal
Off to nowhere
Off to nowhere
Off to nowhere

The only thing you've got
You know you're better off without it

Youngest fire, you decide
You decide what is right
Youngest fire, who decide
We decide what is right

Near yet so far, isn't it?`,
`[Verse 1]
I want you to know the truth
'Cause I've been around before
Thought I wasn't looking anymore

[Verse 2]
Been a fool for weeks
'Cause my heart stands for nothing
And your soul's too weak
Got a will that's been around for days
Goes far, if you want it
It needs to behave

[Pre-Chorus]
But then you, you come around
Big mistake

[Chorus]
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
We don't need a sign to know
Better times

[Bridge]
Running around cause you beat yourself up
And you made a crack and the one that you love is gone
How much longer can you play with fire
Before you turn into a liar?

Running around cause you beat yourself up
And you made a crack and the one that you love is gone
How much longer can you play with fire
Before you turn into a liar?

[Verse 3]
I've been around before
Thought you weren't looking anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
But then we, we come and go
Go up in smoke

[Chorus]
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
We don't need a sign to know
Better times`,
`[Verse 1]
The heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw
Put your hand on this stone, it's the stone of a home you know
They say we will go far, but they don't know how far we'll go
With our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon

[Verse 2]
They say we can throw far but they don't know how far we throw
With our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon
The heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw
They say we will go far, but they don't know how far we'll go

[Chorus]
It can't be gone, we're still right here
It took so long, can't say we heard it all
Limbs parallel, we stood so long we fell
Tear a moment from the days that carry us on forever

[Verse 3]
This push and pull is the force of a wave of time
In the heat of the night, we would cry, you are not mine
They said we would go far, but they don't know how far we'd go
'Cause this heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw

[Chorus]
It can't be gone, we're still right here
It took so long, can't say we saw it all
Limbs parallel, we stood so long we fell
Bright pyramids at night, they carry us on forever

It can't be gone, we're still right here
It took so long, can't say we felt it all
Limbs parallel, we stood so long we fell
Love's like a pantheon, it carries on forever

`,
`[Verse 1]
I met you somewhere in a hell beneath the stairs
There's someone in that room that frightens you when they go boom
The color you say is black is the one you might lack
In the size of your eyes, is there a righteous prize?

[Chorus]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I met you, I met you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh

[Verse 2]
There's something wrong with our hearts
When they beat pure, they stand apart
In the black room, the light, watch the seabird fall
Real love, it finds you somewhere with your back to it

[Chorus]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I met you, I met you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh

[Outro]
You know, you know
We belong by the stream, into the dawn
You know, you know
We belong by the stream, into the dawn
You know, you know
We belong by the stream, into the dawn
You know, you know
We belong by the stream, into the dawn`,
`[Verse 1]
Stand beside it, we can't hide the way it makes us glow
It's no good unless it grows, feel this burning, love of mine
Deep inside the ever-spinning, tell me does it feel?
It's no good unless it's real, hill sides burning
Wild-eyed turning 'til we're running from it

[Chorus]
I'd take care of you if you'd ask me to
In a year or two

[Verse 2]
You say swimming in the lake we'll come across a snake
It is real and then it's fake, feel its heartbeat
Feel what you heat, far so fast it feels too late

[Chorus]
I'd take care of you if you'd ask me to
In a year or two

[Outro]
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
[Repeat until end]
